üîß Backend Logic of Outage Detection (like Downdetector)
1. Data Ingestion Layer

Sources of reports:

Direct user submissions (via site/app forms: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt login‚Äù, ‚ÄúSite down‚Äù).

Social media APIs (Twitter/X keyword scraping).

Third-party monitoring feeds (DNS lookup failures, ping checks, etc. ‚Äî optional).

Processing pipeline:

Store each report in a DB (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or time-series DB).

Normalize reports (e.g., "no internet" ‚Üí category connectivity).

2. Baseline Modeling

For each service, Downdetector has a baseline model of "normal traffic" (historical average reports per minute/hour for that service at that time of day).

Example: Netflix usually gets 5‚Äì10 reports/hour at night.

Backend stores baseline thresholds:

{
  "service": "netflix",
  "time_window": "minute",
  "baseline_avg": 8,
  "threshold": 20
}

3. Anomaly Detection Logic

New reports are aggregated in real-time (sliding time window).

Compare current_count vs. baseline_avg.

If current_count > baseline_avg * factor (e.g., 3x normal), trigger an outage alert.

Pseudo-code:

def detect_outage(service, reports_last_15_min, baseline):
    if reports_last_15_min > baseline * 3:
        return True  # Outage detected
    return False


This prevents false alarms from random small spikes.

4. Geolocation & Clustering

Each report is enriched with:

IP-based geolocation (city, country).

ISP info (from ASN lookup).

Backend groups reports by region ‚Üí creates heatmaps.

Example DB schema:

reports (
    id SERIAL,
    service VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    issue_type VARCHAR,
    ip VARCHAR,
    city VARCHAR,
    country VARCHAR,
    isp VARCHAR
)

5. Aggregation & Storage

Time-series DB (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, or Elasticsearch) stores counts over time.

Aggregated metrics:

total_reports

unique_users

locations_distribution

top_issue_types

6. Visualization & API

Backend provides APIs for frontend graphs:

/api/outages?service=netflix ‚Üí return last 24h report counts + baseline.

/api/heatmap?service=netflix ‚Üí return geo-clusters.

Frontend then draws:

Graph with baseline vs actual reports.

Heatmap of locations affected.

7. Tracking & Updates

System keeps outage states:

Ongoing outage (threshold exceeded).

Resolved (reports back to baseline).

Notifications/updates are published in near real-time.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack (typical)

Ingestion: Kafka / RabbitMQ (for stream processing).

Storage: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB / Elasticsearch for time-series queries.

Anomaly Detection: Python/Go microservices.
